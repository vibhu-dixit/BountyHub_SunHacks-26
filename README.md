# #🎯 BountyBoard – Freelancing Meets Bounty Hunting  

## Overview  
BountyBoard is a web platform that blends the **urgency of bounty hunting** with the **flexibility of freelancing**.  
Clients post tasks—design, development, writing, video editing, and more—with a **bounty reward**. Students (our “hunters”) race to claim and complete these tasks on a **first come, first serve** basis.  

- **For clients:** Get work done faster without long hiring cycles.  
- **For students:** Gain real-world experience, build portfolios, and get paid quickly.  

This project aims to **bridge the gap between college and the corporate world**, helping students transition smoothly into professional life.

## ✨ Inspiration  
We were inspired by two problems we kept seeing:  
1. Students at ASU wanting **real-world experience and income** but struggling with slow, competitive freelance platforms.  
2. Clients needing **fast, affordable work** without sifting through endless proposals.  

By combining **bounty mechanics** with **gig work**, we found a way to serve both sides.

## 🧩 What We Learned  
- How to design a platform that emphasizes **speed, fairness, and usability**.  
- The importance of a **streamlined user flow** for claiming and delivering tasks.  
- Insights into how different industries (design, dev, writing, video) approach deadlines and deliverables.

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI.  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express for authentication, bounty posting, and submissions.  
- **Database:** MongoDB for handling tasks, users, and transactions.
