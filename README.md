**BountyBoard – Freelancing Meets Bounty Hunting**

# Overview
BountyBoard is a web platform that blends the urgency of bounty hunting with the flexibility of freelancing.
Clients post tasks—design, development, writing, video editing, and more—with a bounty reward. Students (our “hunters”) race to claim and complete these tasks on a first come, first serve basis.

For clients: Get work done faster without long hiring cycles.
For students: Gain real-world experience, build portfolios, and get paid quickly.
This project aims to bridge the gap between college and the corporate world, helping students transition smoothly into professional life.

# Inspiration
We were inspired by two problems we kept seeing:

Students at ASU wanting real-world experience and income but struggling with slow, competitive freelance platforms.
Clients needing fast, affordable work without sifting through endless proposals.
By combining bounty mechanics with gig work, we found a way to serve both sides.

# What We Learned
How to design a platform that emphasizes speed, fairness, and usability.
The importance of a streamlined user flow for claiming and delivering tasks.
Insights into how different industries (design, dev, writing, video) approach deadlines and deliverables.

# How We Built It
Frontend: React + Typescript for responsive, modern UI.
Backend: Node.js + Express for authentication, bounty posting, and submissions.
Database: MongoDB for handling tasks, users, and transactions.
